<!-- Doug:

  Hey Ben, just some general advice to make sure you have your JavaScript console open in your browser while you're working. Maybe you did, but I just wanted to point it out since that's what revealed the most to me what your issues were. There were a lot of error messages about not being to load certain files, so I spent some time going through your code fixing a few things. I added comments next to the things I fixed.
